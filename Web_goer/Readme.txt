Used programming language: Python

Python implementation: CPython


this is a simple GUI. which will take you to your desired webpage


there is a bug. it will only work with the website name where is only "www." at first 
and ".com" at last.

example: you can use this gui to go for www.google.com

but you cannot use this for www.python.org.

no problem it is under construction too..
